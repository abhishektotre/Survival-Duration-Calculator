# Survival Duration Calculator
## Overview
The Survival Duration Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate the duration of a person's life in various time units based on their age. Users can input their age and select a time unit (e.g., months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds) to determine how long they've lived in that unit. This project showcases basic Python programming skills, including user input handling, conditional statements, and mathematical calculations.

## Installation
To set up and run the Survival Duration Calculator, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/survival-duration-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd survival-duration-calculator
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies: The project does not require any external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.

## Run the application:

python survival_duration_calculator.py
Usage
Run the application by executing the Python script:

python survival_duration_calculator.py
Enter your age when prompted.

Choose a time unit (Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, or Seconds). You can enter the full name or the first letter of the time unit.

View the result which shows how long you have lived in the selected time unit.

Example:
